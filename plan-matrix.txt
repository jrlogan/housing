Binary criteria on homeless
Ternary criteria (may, must, can't) on housing programmes
-> display eligibility for programs per individual
Death score

Store homeless stats
Store program stats
Store apartment stats

Inventory of housing? Scarcity around available housing
-> matching the person on top of the list that is eligible



(Is there flexibility?)

Use case: landlord comes in and says, "we have ten apartments available"

Pecking order: We want to match by SCORE first, with tie-breakers:

== Models
Store homeless stats
Store program stats
Store apartment stats

== Controllers
CRUD all the models
(Batch-)add apartments
Auto-suggest the homeless/program/apartment matching
Manual override for the matching?

Yay!
